          <h2>Accomplishments & Reflections</h2>
          <p>
            So far, we have the project setup in Unity using compute shaders,
            with rendering complete using a material shader. With this, we
            completed the first milestone of getting an Eulerian fluid
            simulation working in Unity, complete with basic mouse interactions
            to remove obstructing terrain.
          </p>
          <p>
            Our team chose to go for FLIP fluid simulation in the end, which is
            a hybrid of both Eulerian and Lagrangian approaches. We are
            implementing the Eulerian fluid simulation first since FLIP is built
            on top of it.
          </p>
          <p>
            At the same time, we also have a couple level designs setup for the
            game (we are going for a Where's My Water clone). We're also in the
            middle of implementing the level loader, which loads levels from a
            texture file that describes the level.
          </p>
          <p>
            We're making good pace so far towards our goal. Despite accidentally
            thinking we had one more week than we actually did, we should still
            be on track to finishing our project by the deadline with some time
            to spare.
          </p>

          <h2>Schedule</h2>
          <p>
            We will be keeping the schedule roughly the same as we had in our
            proposal.
