            <b>Summary</b><br />
            A real-time, high definition voxel falling sand game with several
            different materials. Simulates interactions between different
            material properties and offers an interesting sandbox playground.

        <section>
          <h2>Problem Description</h2>
          <p>
            We were inspired by falling sand games like sandboxels that
            simulated chemical reactions using pixels and cellular automation.
          </p>
          <p>
            We want to build on traditional falling sand games and improve its
            realism by extending it into 3D. We also aim to optimize the
            simulation as much as possible, allowing potentially thousands of
            small voxel particles to interact with each other in real time.
          </p>
          <p>
            To go a step further, we plan to implement shaders that reflect
            differently for different materials. For example, coarse and bumpy
            material for sand, but reflective and translucent material for
            water.
          </p>
          <p>
            We believe this problem is important because it simulates falling
            particles like sand and gravel in a 3D environment. This can be a
            great improvement in realism for voxel-based sandbox games if
            optimizations are done correctly.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, it is also a difficult problem to consider because voxel
            simulations involve updating a large cubic grid. We have to consider
            different acceleration schemes to be able to simulate high
            definition voxel falling sand simulations.
          </p>
          <p>
            One approach that we considered is to consider the voxel grid as a
            one dimensional vector, thus the position of any voxel can be
            interpreted as an integer index into this vector. We can then
            iterate only on a queue of vectors that will move, eliminating the
            need to iterate over the entire grid.
          </p>
          <p>
            We are also considering the use of compute shaders to help us
            parallelize the simulation on the GPU, which will further reduce the
            simulation time.
          </p>
          <p>
            For rendering, we plan to use ray marching to render only the
            visible parts of each voxel. We also have plans to adjust the
            reflectance and refraction of light in the ray marching rendering to
            give a more visibly convincing representation of different material.
          </p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h2>Goals and Deliverables</h2>
          <p>
            For our final deliverable, we want to create a performant, real-time
            demo of sand-like particles in a voxel environment, complete with
            kinematics, material reactions, and user interactions.
          </p>
          <p>
            To measure the quality of our demo, we will track the simulation
            time, mesh generation time, and the average FPS of the demo, as we
            implement each successive optimization. Ideally, we want the
            simulation and render times to be low, which would also increase the
            average FPS.
          </p>
          <p>
            Considering we only have a limited amount of time to work on this,
            we want to prioritize having a working demo first. Then work on
            optimizations for a higher number of voxels, followed by the falling
            sand simulation. After that, we can work on different material
            properties.
          </p>
          <p>
            The above should all be achievable within the given timeframe. If we
            are able to deliver ahead of schedule, we will tackle the use of ray
            marching for distinct material shading, particle kinematics (i.e.
            varying velocity), and edge smoothing.
